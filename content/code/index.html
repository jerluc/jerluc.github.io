  I currently work as a software developer in the energy industry where I lead the technical
  direction for our core software architecture. In the process, I write a lot of code for
  distributed systems, networking, infrastructure, and other core systems. In my spare time, I enjoy
  writing code for gaming, music, IoT, and plenty of others.
