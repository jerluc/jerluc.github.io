Let me start off by really framing the context for this tutorial series with a list of
<i>unreasonable</i> expectations:
</p>
<h4>Unreasonable expectations:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I am a smart person; therefore, I will be a good programmer.</li>
  <li>I don't consider myself a smart person; therefore, I could never be a good programmer.</li>
  <li>I will learn everything I will ever need to know about programming from this tutorial
    series.</li>
  <li>I will be able to build my own mobile app and make gajillions of monies, just by reading this
  entire tutorial series!</li>
</ul>
<p>
If any of the above bullet points was going through your head before you clicked on the link that
led you here, please read the below list of <i>reasonable</i> expectations.
</p>
<h4>Reasonable expectations:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You will learn the basic skills required to only <i>begin</i> your journey of becoming a
    programmer.</li>
  <li>You will screw up more than once before getting your programs to work, but this is normal! My
  only suggestion here is to wear a helmet in order to prevent permanent damage sustained through
  constant head-to-keyboard collisions.</li>
  <li>You should expect to be successful if you have sufficient typing skills and can use critical
    thinking to solve problems.</li>
  <li>You (and every other programmer out there) are about as likely to create the Next Big
    Thing&trade; as to be struck by lightning twice in the same part of the body.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Now that we have all of these harsh realities out of the way, let's get started with the lessons!
