<p>
Before we get too deep into what programming is, let's briefly entertain the topic of "why does
programming exist?" and "how did we get to programming?"
</p>
<h2>How did we get to programming?</h2>
<p>
Over the decades, we as creatures have evolved to produce tools and technology for simplifying or
improving our lives. Initially, this may have started with something as simple as learning to use
certain materials for starting a controlled fire, with which we could cook our food. And then
eventually, this would progress into learning how to apply physical mechanics to do such things as
lifting heavy objects, such as with a pulley system, or combining physical mechanics with chemical
reactions for producing a means of transportation, such as with steam engines and later combustion
engines.
</p>
<p>
As time went on throughout the history of humanity, our tools and technology would continue to
progress, building upon previously existing tools to create more complex tools that could do more,
in less time, at [generally] less cost.
</p>
<p>
In the digital revolution, we continue along the same path of using existing technologies to
give rise to newer tools. Were it not for the ability to harness electricity as a form of energy and
the knowledge of the conductivity of materials such as copper wire, it's likely we would not find
ourselves in this era of miniaturized computers, smartphones, and artifical intelligence.
</p>
<p>
There is a common misconception that computers are smart, and as a seasoned software engineer, I can
tell you that this is completely false. In fact, though computers might be able to add two numbers
together faster than you can blink, they are, in fact, incredibly stupid machines that know nothing
more than you tell it.
</p>

<p>
Programming is like giving a set of step-by-step instructions to the computer to know
both what we want to do and how to do it. It is only by combining these step-by-step instructions
along with the computer's ability to do mathematical operations very quickly that we can achieve
"smartness" and build software for doing interesting things.
</p>
<h2>Step-by-step instructions</h2>
<p>
I personally like to think of programming much like the process of giving turn-by-turn navigation
to someone trying to get from point A to point B:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/navigation_1.jpg" alt="Navigation from point A to point B"/>
</p>
<p>
In this example, if we wanted to give the turn-by-turn instructions from point A to point B
(assuming each square to be a city block), we could say something like:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Head east for two blocks</li>
  <li>Turn left and head north for another two blocks</li>
  <li>Turn right and head east again for another block</li>
  <li>Turn left and head north for one last block and you'll arrive at your destination</li>
</ol>
<p>
Sometimes though, it becomes tedious to give very specific instructions such as "walk 8 blocks"
because sometimes we don't even know precisely how many blocks there are:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/images/navigation_2.jpg" alt="Navigation from point A to point B (again)"/>
</p>
<p>
In this example, assuming we didn't know exactly how many blocks were after that first left turn, we
might get creative and say something simpler:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Head east for two blocks</li>
  <li>Turn left and head north <i>until you arrive at your destination</i></li>
</ol>
<p>
By using this new way of describing directions, not only have we made the directions more concise,
but we've also, in a sense, made them more forgiving (we might have otherwise given the wrong
directions if we tried using an exact number of blocks to travel before stopping).

  <p>Now it's your turn! Using no more than 2 instructions, give the steps you'd list out to someone
  trying to get from point A to point B (hint: it may be useful to use the intermediary point a):</p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <ol id="answers1">
    <li><span class="answer">Head east until you arrive at point a.</span></li>
    <li><span class="answer">Turn right and head south until you arrive at your destination</span></li>
  </ol>

<h2>Programming languages</h2>
<p>
Programming is often done by using a special language, quite suitingly called a <em>programming
language</em>, to create a set of instructions, called a <em>program</em>. The program is then
given to the computer which typically will interpret the program's contents to perform whatever
function is desired.
</p>
<p>
Just as in human languages, a programming language is made up of a vocabulary, grammar, syntax (for
example, punctuation), and semantics (what actually makes sense in a sentence?). Similarly, in the
above navigation examples, the programming language can be thought of as:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Vocabulary</dt><dd>Turn (verb), left/right (noun), head (verb), north/south/east/west (noun), walk
    (verb), etc.</dd>
  <dt>Grammar</dt><dd>Sentences are made up of a verb followed by a noun</dd>
  <dt>Syntax</dt><dd>English syntax</dd>
  <dt>Semantics</dt><dd>The verb "turn" should only be followed with a direction ("left" or
  "right"), etc.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Different kinds of programming languages</h2>
<p>
As you might have guessed, not all programming languages are the same. Some use a different
vocabulary with made-up words. Some use a grammar that looks nothing like English. Some use bizarre
punctuation all over the place. And some even have semantics whose meaning changes depending on
context.
</p>
<p>
You might be wondering, "Why would you use one programming language over another?" Generally
speaking, not all programming languages are built to be able to solve all problems. For example,
some languages might be easier to use for building a web page, others maybe better suited for
mathematical computations, etc.
</p>
<p>
Blockly is an example of a programming language that both has a unique language and has a fairly
specific purpose. Firstly, it is a <em>visual programming language</em> which means the vocabulary
used in this language is represented with visual components (in this case, blocks). Furthermore, the
grammar of the language allows a programmer to only put blocks together in certain combinations,
much like the pieces of a puzzle. Blockly was created specifically for the purpose of teach new
programmers how to solve problems using a programming language.

computer, let's continue our journey with our first look at how to get the computer to do something
for us!
