<h2>Resilience</h2>
<p>
It's been a difficult couple of months lately. As you may already know, my previous employer fired
me for refusing to accept a job offer at Pinterest
<a href="https://recode.net/2016/05/03/pinterest-acqhire-advertising-urx/">during acquisition</a>. To
top it off, my flatmate had been job-hunting in order to transfer his work visa, a very frustrating
and time-consuming process that could have left him having to leave the country, and me having to
find a new place to rent amid the
<a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/national-rent-data/">highest ever recorded rental
prices in San Francisco</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this isn't the worse that could have happened. But you know what? I feel happier than
ever now. I feel for the first time in almost a year more motivated to pursue my interests, to
continue finding myself, and to make whatever changes I need in order to succeed.
</p>
<p>
In fact, so far this month: I've made great progress on a project that I hope to someday grow into a
company, I've applied and/or interviewed with three different companies whose work pertains to
fields about which I am actually passionate, I've resumed taking copious amounts of notes about
various projects or ideas I have (which I stopped doing after months of menial work), and I've also
been talking more with old friends who had been out of touch. At this rate, I'm actually quite
surprised I haven't yet won the lottery.
</p>
<p>
But I haven't always been like this. Far from it. I can easily recall the myriad of times growing up
when I would have given up at the first sign of doubt.
</p>
<p>
I remember quite distinctly being somewhere around 8 years old when I used to play in little league
baseball. To be entirely frank: I sucked at bat. I was always so afraid of the ball; it's red
stitching trying to hold in its own laughter whenever I winced at it. And the worse part was, as a
kid, I couldn't quite understand why the heck the coach kept making me bat. I mean, it's not as if
I'd magically stop fearing the ball. Or maybe he had hoped that I would be pegged and at least get
to walk a base. I never could understand. And thus, I was never a very resilient kid growing up.
</p>
<p>
But you see, that's where this person comes in:

<p>
That's my mom, and she's <em>amazing</em>.
</p>
<p>
You see, even though I kept missing the ball during baseball games, my mom would still take me out
to practice batting almost every other week. I used to hate it. Every single time, I'd be crying
telling Mom, "I don't want to," or "stop it, you're throwing too hard." She'd just sigh and tell me
to at least keep facing the ball and try to swing. But this wasn't to improve my swing, you see. My
mom wanted me to get used to the simple fact that despite how I may feel about it, I better get used
to the fact that once in a while I'm going to have to face a hard ball whether I'm ready for it or
not, and hell, if I get the chance, I ought to swing as well.
</p>
<p>
And so eventually, when I was older, I would go on to finally hit the ball for both the first and
last time. But that's okay, I was never much of a baseball fan anyway. However, the lesson learned
that you don't get to choose what kind of pitch is thrown&mdash;a hard ball, a curve ball, or a ball
coming straight at your face&mdash;that's something I kept with me the past 20 years since those
days.
</p>
<p>
So now, when I think about where I am today, despite the hardship of uncertainty, fear, and doubt, I
can think back to that empowering idea my mom gave me about resilience and adapting to my
circumstances, and think to myself: "Yes, I can do this."
</p>
<p>
Happy Mother's Day, Mom &hearts;
